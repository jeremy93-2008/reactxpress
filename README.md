## Features

-   Server-side rendering (SSR) of React components for improved performance and SEO.
-   Hydration of the rendered React components on the client-side for interactivity.
-   API and middleware support through Express to handle server-side logic and data fetching.
-   Configured webpack setup for bundling and optimizing the client-side code.
-   Hot module replacement (HMR) for seamless development experience.
